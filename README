This go based raytracer was originally written by Jack Palevich. For more information, see http://grammerjack.blogspot.com/2009/11/multi-threaded-go-raytracer.html.

I use this as a performance test for go and to reveal possible bottlenecks and issues with high-performance math based 'stress'.

HOW TO
-------
 run 
 
 make image 
 
 to produce an image in out.tga while printing timing information to stdout.
 This works in the go as well in the c++ version.
